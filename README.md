# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation Using KMeans
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm. It focuses on dividing customers into distinct groups based on their shopping patterns, providing insights for targeted marketing strategies.

Key Features:
Dataset: Used a dataset of mall customers containing attributes such as gender, age, annual income, and spending score.
Clustering:
Performed clustering using KMeans.
Determined optimal clusters (3 and 5 clusters) based on the Elbow Method.
Correlation Analysis:
Included a correlation table to analyze relationships between features.
Utilized this analysis to refine the clustering process.
Visualizations:
Visualized the customer segments for both 3 and 5 clusters.
Insights include behavioral patterns and spending trends for each cluster.
Tools & Technologies:
Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook
Insights & Learnings:
The clustering results reveal distinct customer groups based on age, income, and spending behavior.
Comparison of 3 and 5 clusters highlights varying levels of granularity in customer segmentation.
The correlation table provided valuable context for feature selection and interpretation.
